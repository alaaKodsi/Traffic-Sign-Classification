# signature_senior_project

The project is an easy-to-use mobile application dedicated to recognizing traffic signals by pre-trained neural network technology.
Through the application, you can take a photo directly or through a photo previously saved in the gallery.
After the image is taken, it is processed in main steps and in sequence, and through the API, it communicates with the neural network, and we take a result from it, if the image that was taken is a traffic signal or something else, and a signal name is sent if it is recognized as a traffic signal, all of this is built in an easy to use and user friendly mobile application.
